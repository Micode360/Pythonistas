=== For Loop *****


 Loops in Python are used to execute a block of code repeatedly as long as a condition is true. There are mainly two types of loops in Python: for loops and while loops. Let's dive into each one and provide some examples:



#  
for item in sequence:
    # code block to be execute

```
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)

```


while loop 
# while condition:
    # code block to be executed


condition is evaluated before each iteration. If it evaluates to True, the loop continues; otherwise, it terminates.


```
num = 1
while num <= 5:
    print(num)
    num += 1

```
