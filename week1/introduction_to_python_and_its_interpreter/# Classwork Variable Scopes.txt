# Classwork: Variable Scopes

# 1. Create a variable 'global_var' with a value of 10. Print its value.


# 2. Define a function 'example_function' which does the following:
#    a. Creates a variable 'local_var' with a value of 20.
#    b. Prints the value of 'local_var'.
#    c. Prints the value of 'global_var' from within the function.


# 3. Call 'example_function'.


# 4. Try printing 'local_var' from outside the function. What happens? Explain why.


# 5. Create a variable 'another_global_var' inside a block (also scope) (e.g., function or if statement) in a new function
#    Try accessing 'another_global_var' from outside the block. What happens? Explain why.


# 6. Create a constant 'PI' with a value of 3.14. Try changing its value. What happens? Explain why.

# Bonus: Try to print 'global_var' and 'another_global_var' before they're declared. What happens? Explain why.

# Your task is to complete the code and run it to observe the output.
